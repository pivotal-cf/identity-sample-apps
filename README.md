# Pivotal Single Sign-On Service Sample Applications

This repo holds separate sample applications for each one of the four OAuth 2.0 grant types supported by the Pivotal Single Sign-On Service. The GRANT_TYPE environment variable is already set to the relevant value mentioned below for each sample application. Each grant type maps to an Application Type as seen in the Pivotal Single Sign-On Service Dashboard. 

Application Type  | Grant Type
------------- | -------------
[Web App](/authcode)  | authorization_code
[Native Mobile App](/password)  | password
[Service-to-Service App](/client_credentials) | client_credentials
[Single Page JavaScript App](/implicit) | implicit

## <a name="step-1">Step 1</a>: Deploy Sample Application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

Set the correct CF API target in the CF CLI and login as a Space Developer into the required Org and Space

    cf api api.<your-domain>
    
Go to your application directory and push the app.

    ./gradlew build
    cf push

NOTE: If you are using a public IP, you will need to update the internal_proxies variable in application.yml to your public IP.

## <a name="step-2">Step 2</a>: Bind the Application with the Pivotal Single Sign-On Service Instance
Follow the steps [here](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/configure-apps/index.html#bind) to bind your application to the service instance.

Restart your application after binding the service using Apps Manager or CF CLI.


# Resource Server Sample Application

## Deploying Resource Server

### Setup
The resource server needs to know the Auth Server (or UAA) location in order to retrieve the token key to validate the tokens. 
Set the Auth Server location as the value of the auth_domain environment variable for the authcode sample app.

`cf set-env <RESOURCE_SERVER_APP_NAME> AUTH_SERVER <AUTH_SERVER_LOCATION>`

For example, for a given SSO service plan/UAA identity zone, the location would be `https://subdomain.login.my-domain.org`

It has three API endpoints:
 * `GET /todo` to list TODO items. Requires the user to have `todo.read` scope.
 * `POST /todo` to create a TODO item. Requires `todo.write` scope. Example body: `{"todo":"<content>"}`
 * `DELETE /todo/{id}` to delete a TODO item. Requires `todo.write` scope.

To push the app, follow steps [1](#step-1) and [2](#step-2) of the previous section.

## Setting up Authcode Sample App to use Resource Server

Currently, only the authcode sample app uses the resource server, but the other grant types should be similar.
The authcode sample app needs to know the resource server location in order to manage TODO resources.

`cf set-env <AUTHCODE_APP_NAME> RESOURCE_URL <RESOURCE_SERVER_URL>`

NOTE: You must remove the trailing slash ('/') from the URL.

For the sample app to work you need to go to the Resource dashboard and create a Resource with name `todo` and `todo.read` and `todo.write` permissions.
After creating the resource, you need to update the authcode-sample app with the previously created scopes on the App dashboard.
Follow the steps [here](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/manage-resources.html) to create the resource and permissions.

The authenticated user should also have the scopes `todo.read` and `todo.write`.

NOTE: If a user doesn't have these scopes, contact your local admin to grant these scopes to that user.

# Bootstrap Application Client Configurations for the Pivotal Single Sign-On Service Instance
Beginning in SSO 1.4.0, you can use the following values your application's manifest to bootstrap client configurations for your applications automatically when binding or rebinding your application to the service instance. These values will be automatically populated to the client configurations for your application through CF environment variables.

When you specify your own scopes and authorities, consider including openid for scopes on auth code, implicit, and password grant type applications, and uaa.resource for client credentials grant type applications, as these will not be provided if they are not specified.

The table below provides a description and the default values. Further details and examples are provided in the sample application manifests.

| Property Name | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| name | Name of the application | (N/A - Required Value) |
| GRANT_TYPE | Allowed grant type for the application through the SSO service - only one grant type per application is supported by SSO | (N/A - You must specify the value) |
| SSO_IDENTITY_PROVIDERS | Allowed identity providers for the application through the SSO service plan | Yes | uaa |
| SSO_REDIRECT_URIS | Comma separated whitelist of redirection URIs allowed for the application - Each value must start with http:// or https:// |  (Will always include the application route) |
| SSO_SCOPES | Comma separated list of scopes that belong to the application and are registered as client scopes with the SSO service |  openid (uaa.resource for client credentials)|
| SSO_AUTO_APPROVED_SCOPES | Comma separated list of scopes that the application is automatically authorized when acting on behalf of users through SSO service | openid (uaa.resource for client credentials) |
| SSO_AUTHORITIES | Comma separated list of authorities that belong to the application and are registered as client authorities with the SSO service - privileged identity zone/plan administrator scopes (e.g. scim.read, idps.write) cannot be bootstrapped and must be assigned by zone/plan administrators | openid (uaa.resource for client credentials) |
| SSO_REQUIRED_USER_GROUPS | Comma separated list of groups a user must have in order to authenticate successfully for the application | (No value) |
| SSO_ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME | Lifetime in seconds for the access token issued to the application by the SSO service | 43200 |
| SSO_REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME | Lifetime in seconds for the refresh token issued to the application by the SSO service | 2592000 (not used for client credentials) |
| SSO_RESOURCES |  Resources that the application will use as scopes/authorities for the SSO service to be created during bootstrapping if they do not already exist - The input format can be referenced in the provided sample manifest| (No value) |
| SSO_ICON |  Application icon that will be displayed next to the application name on the Pivotal Account dashboard if show on home page is enabled - do not exceed 64kb | (No value) |
| SSO_LAUNCH_URL |  Application launch URL that will be used for the application on the Pivotal Account dashboard if show on home page is enabled | (Application route) |
| SSO_SHOW_ON_HOME_PAGE |  If set to true, the application will appear on the Pivotal Account dashboard with the corresponding icon and launch URL| True |
